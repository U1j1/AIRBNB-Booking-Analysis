The purpose of the analysis: understanding the factors that influence Airbnb prices in New York City, or identifying patterns of all variables and Our analysis provides useful information for travelers and hosts in the city and also provides some best insights for Airbnb business. This project involved exploring and cleaning a dataset to prepare it for analysis. The data exploration process involved identifying and understanding the characteristics of the data, such as the data types, missing values, and distributions of values. The data cleaning process involved identifying and addressing any issues or inconsistencies in the data, such as errors, missing values, or duplicate records and remove outliers.

## **Introduction of Airbnb**
1. Airbnb is a popular online platform that allows individuals to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world. It was founded in 2008 by Brian Chesky, Joe Gebbia and Nathan Blecharczyk, and has since become the largest and most successful home-sharing companies in the world.

## The Purpose of the Analysis

Through this process, we were able to identify and fix any issues with the data, and ensure that it was ready for further analysis. This is an important step in any data analysis project, as it allows us to work with high-quality data and avoid any potential biases or errors that could affect the results. The clean and prepared data can now be used to answer specific research. Once the data has been cleaned and prepared, now begin exploring and summarizing it with describe the data and creating visualizations, and identifying patterns and trends in the data. in explore the data, may develop the relationships between different variables or the underlying causes of certain patterns or trends and other methods. Using data visualization to explore and understand patterns in Airbnb data. We created various graphs and charts to visualize the data, and wrote observations and insights below each one to help us better understand the data and identify useful insights and patterns. Through this process, we were able to uncover trends and relationships in the data that would have been difficult to identify through raw data alone, for example factors affecting prices and availability. We found that minimum nights, number of reviews, and host listing count are important for determining prices, and that availability varies significantly across neighborhoods. Our analysis provides useful information for travelers and hosts in the city. The observations and insights we identified through this process will be useful for future analysis and decision-making related to Airbnb. and also Our analysis provides useful information for travelers and hosts in the city.
